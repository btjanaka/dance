# Surrounding Nitrogen Molecules

This directory contains an example of using DANCE to select molecules with 
single nitrogen to nitrogen bonds. The main purpose of this directory is to
test a fingerprint that compares molecules based off the atoms surrounding 
their nitrogen-nitrogen bonds and the Wiberg bond orders of the bond(s). As
this fingeprint is still being tested and is computationally expensive, it is
not meant for larger databases like eMolecules.
